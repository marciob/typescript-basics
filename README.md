## Typescript Basic

Typescript is basically Javascript with type checking, so the type of the variable is explicitly set in the declaration.

It behaviors as static typing, so it can't change the type once it already was created.

### Drawbacks:

- compilation
- current browsers don't read typescript, so the code is compiled into javascript code in order to run in browsers
  this proccess is called transpilation

## Basic commands

### .ts

typescript extensions

### tsc

that command transpile all .ts files into javascript

### tsc tsFileName.ts

transpile a specific typescript file into javascript

### tsc --init

it creates configuration file for typescript
tsconfig.json

### tsc --watch

It watches files changings
